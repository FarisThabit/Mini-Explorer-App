Features:

Content Display: Once a folder is selected, the app displays the contents of the folder in an organized and easy-to-read format.
Size Visualization: The app provides a visual representation of the sizes of the children in the selected folder. This is done through bar charts and pie charts, making it easy to understand the storage distribution at a glance.
